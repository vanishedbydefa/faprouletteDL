### Parameter option -s --speed
Use this parameter to drastically speed up the download process. Faproulette.co is using increasing IDs for the roulette.
Because it's not public which are valid IDs, the downloader normally tries every ID. Once scraped all images, we know which IDs
are used. This allows us to ignore the unused IDs in the future. The parameter -s --speed takes an existing database as data source
for the IDs. The program will only download the images, which IDs are stored in the database. This maybe results in missing images.
When ever a new roulette is uploaded, it gets a new ID that's one higher than the previous image. In case a roulette wasn't visible/reachable
when the database got created, the roulette wouldn't be downloaded in speed mode. I never observed this, so I would recommend to use -s --speed.

Notice: Place "image_data_source.db" in the folder in which you want to download the images!
